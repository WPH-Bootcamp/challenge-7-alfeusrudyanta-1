List priority from top to bottom :
my cart
page my-cart => do not forget to include is pending
page checkout => get param from restaurant id
page success
page detail

add category in case zero, make it so it does not depend on price max-min
add isloading, error, not-found page => all page (add hooks on my order page)

not found => restaurant, checkout, success

redux => for address => also create update address for checkout and profile => to a new page (both)
profile page => create update profile button function
main page => see if i can add recommended
